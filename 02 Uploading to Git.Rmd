So now to install Git and upload your things to it...  

##### What is a Git respository  
  
Git:  
- version control for tracking changes in computer files; use for coordinating works  
GitHub:
- repository hosting service  
  
###### Git commands  
  
`Git config`:  
= configure username and email address  
`Git init`:  
- initialize local Git repository  
`Git add`:  
- add one or more files to staging area  
`Git diff`:  
- view channges nade to file  
`Git commit`:  
- commit changes to head but not to remote repository  
`Git rest`:  
- undo local changes to state of Git repo  
`Git status`:  
- displays state of working directory and staging area  
`Git merge`:  
- merge branch intoa active branch  
`Git push`:  
- upload content from local to remote repository  
`Git pull`:  
- fetch and download content from remote repository  

    
##### installing homebrew  
  
First need to install homebrew, but [what is it...](https://opensource.com/article/20/6/homebrew-mac)  
  
Homebrew:  
- = a package manager  
- to insteall run:  
`$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)`  
---  
###### A little about [curl...](https://linuxize.com/post/curl-command-examples/#:~:text=curl%20is%20a%20command%2Dline,SCP%20%2C%20SFTP%20%2C%20and%20FTP%20.)  
- curl = command-line for transferring data from or to server w/o user interaction; can download or upload data using supported portocols like HTTP, HTTPS, etc.
- can limit bandwidth, proxy support, user authentication, etc.  
`curl syntax: curl [options] [URL...]`  
  
- **if retrieve example.com homepage then:**  
`$ curl example.com`  
- output prints source code of example.com to terminal, no protocol then defaults to HTTP  
- save result use `-o` or `-0` option
- `-o` saves file with predified file name (in example is: vue-v2.6.10.js):
`$ curl -o vue-v2.6.10.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js`  
- `-0` saves with original filename:  
`curl -O https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js`  
  
- **if download multiple files:**  
- use multiple `-0` options followed by URL  
Example:  
`-O https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso`  
  
- **resume a download**  
- use `-C -` option  
- useful if connection drops and instead of starting from scratch can resume  
`curl -C - -O http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ubuntu-18.04-live-server-amd64.iso`  
  
- **get redirect**  
`curl -L google.com`  
- use `-L` option to instruct to redirect to final location  
  
- **specify max transfer rate**  
- `--limit-rate` allows to limie data transfer rate  
- can express by `k`, `m`, `g` for kilo, mega, or gigabytes

now back to homebrew...  
  
- homebrew contains a [list of "formulae"](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/) that help manage software  
- to identify if homebrew has commond line can use following:
```
$ brew search tldr
==> Formulae
tldr âœ”
```  
  
- checkmark lets you know you can install it so then type  
`$ brew install tldr`  
  
- can also use: `$ brew uninsall` to remove unused utilities  

- **can manage apps with brew casks**  
- brew uses the line "cask" for complex multi-directory structures or applications (rather than command lines)  
- so for example if want to install the application "meld" then:  
  
- to first confirm its availability:  
```
$ brew search --casks meld
==> Casks
meld
```  
- once confirmed can used cask sub-command to install:
`$ brew cask install meld`  
  
- **can update everything with brew upgrade**  
- makes it so not needed to manually keep all programs up to date  
  
##### now back to uploading to Git  

###### Basic GitHub setup
  
1. First need to instal git via `brew install git`
2. Create GitHub account
3. Login to GitHub w new account  
  
###### Preparing code for upload  
  
Can store code on GitHub repositiry but need to structure code in `index.html`  
  
Need to also initialize code directory in repository:  
  
1. Point command line to `test-site` directory using `cd`  
example if website is on desktop:  
```
cd Desktop/test-site
```  

2. When command line is pointing inside website directory, type `git init` to turn into git repository  
  
so in my case it would be  
```
cd /Users/benson/R_programming/RJourney/
git init
```  
###### Uploading code via command line
  
**Using command line is the best way to upload to GitHub**  
  
Creating repository for code:
1. Need to first create repository for files via GitHub website
2. Simple and follow instructions for creating respository [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Using_Github_pages)  
  
###### Uploading files to GitHub  
  
1. To push existing repository from command line, need to use code:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/bellwuu/RJourney.git
```  
2. Type following commonds and press enter after each one. These prepare code for uploading to GitHub and asks Git to manage these files
```
git add --all
git commit -m 'adding my files to repository'
```  
3. Push code to GitHub by going to web page and entering into terminal via:  
```
git push -u origin main
```  
4. 
  
But what is gitpush...?  
  
How Github manages data:  
- project added to local repository to be commit
- after commit sent to remote via push 
- need pull to take data from remote repository to local
  
Git push:
= used to push local repository content to remote repository  
- local repository modified, push is executed to share modificaitons with remote team members  
  
*What are SSH keys for GitHub:*  
SSH keys  
= alternate forms of identification that does not require username and password  
- comes in pairs: public key that is shared with services and private key only stored on computer  
- if keys match then granted access
  
[Generating SSH key pair:](https://jdblischak.github.io/2014-09-18-chicago/novice/git/05-sshkeys.html#:~:text=An%20SSH%20key%20is%20an,%2C%20you're%20granted%20access.)
Use this to look to see if you have an SSH key already; if see `id_rsa.pub` then already have one
```
cd ~/.ssh
ls
```
To display content of public key 
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_pub
```  
Output should look like this:
```
ssh-rsa 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 Bell@MacBook-Pro.local
```  
Now copy the contents to GitHub and paste key in account settings -"Add key"
  

  
Demo:  
`git config --list`  
= lists configuration of git  
`pwd`  
- by default always listed as home directory  
`git status`  
- checks status; to see if we are on master branch, etc.
