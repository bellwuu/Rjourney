So now to install Git and upload your things to it...  
    
##### installing homebrew  
  
First need to install homebrew, but [what is it...](https://opensource.com/article/20/6/homebrew-mac)  
  
Homebrew:  
- = a package manager  
- to insteall run:  
`$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)`  
---  
###### A little about [curl...](https://linuxize.com/post/curl-command-examples/#:~:text=curl%20is%20a%20command%2Dline,SCP%20%2C%20SFTP%20%2C%20and%20FTP%20.)  
- curl = command-line for transferring data from or to server w/o user interaction; can download or upload data using supported portocols like HTTP, HTTPS, etc.
- can limit bandwidth, proxy support, user authentication, etc.  
`curl syntax: curl [options] [URL...]`  
  
- **if retrieve example.com homepage then:**  
`$ curl example.com`  
- output prints source code of example.com to terminal, no protocol then defaults to HTTP  
- save result use `-o` or `-0` option
- `-o` saves file with predified file name (in example is: vue-v2.6.10.js):
`$ curl -o vue-v2.6.10.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js`  
- `-0` saves with original filename:  
`curl -O https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js`  
  
- **if download multiple files:**  
- use multiple `-0` options followed by URL  
Example:  
`-O https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso`  
  
- **resume a download**  
- use `-C -` option  
- useful if connection drops and instead of starting from scratch can resume  
`curl -C - -O http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ubuntu-18.04-live-server-amd64.iso`  
  
- **get redirect**  
`curl -L google.com`  
- use `-L` option to instruct to redirect to final location  
  
- **specify max transfer rate**  
- `--limit-rate` allows to limie data transfer rate  
- can express by `k`, `m`, `g` for kilo, mega, or gigabytes

now back to homebrew...  
  
- homebrew contains a [list of "formulae"](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/) that help manage software  
- to identify if homebrew has commond line can use following:
```
$ brew search tldr
==> Formulae
tldr âœ”
```  
  
- checkmark lets you know you can install it so then type  
`$ brew install tldr`  
  
- can also use: `$ brew uninsall` to remove unused utilities  

- **can manage apps with brew casks**  
- brew uses the line "cask" for complex multi-directory structures or applications (rather than command lines)  
- so for example if want to install the application "meld" then:  
  
- to first confirm its availability:  
```
$ brew search --casks meld
==> Casks
meld
```  
- once confirmed can used cask sub-command to install:
`$ brew cask install meld`  
  
- **can update everything with brew upgrade**  
- makes it so not needed to manually keep all programs up to date  
  
##### now back to uploading to Git  

###### Basic GitHub setup
  
1. First need to instal git via `brew install git`
2. Create GitHub account
3. Login to GitHub w new account  
  
###### Preparing code for upload  
  
Can store code on GitHub repositiry but need to structure code in `index.html`  
  
Need to also initialize code directory in repository:  
  
1. Point command line to `test-site` directory using `cd`  
example if website is on desktop:  
```
cd Desktop/test-site
```  

2. When command line is pointing inside website directory, type `git init` to turn into git repository  
  
so in my case it would be  
```
cd /Users/benson/R_programming/RJourney/
git init
```  
###### Uploading code via command line
  
**Using command line is the best way to upload to GitHub**  
  
Creating repository for code:
1. Need to first create repository for files via GitHub website
2. Simple and follow instructions for creating respository [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Using_Github_pages)
